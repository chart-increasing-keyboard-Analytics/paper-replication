# Paper replication

Replication of the paper Built to last or built too fast?: evaluating prediction models for build times[1].

## Data

Pull the data from [TravisTorrent](https://travistorrent.testroots.org/page_access/).
To run our experiment, download and extract to the project root the data folder from the link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PFv_-HHB2aIpxm8xfqCbB9QYfhKl4zB8/view?usp=sharing.

## Environment

Run the script `replication.py` in an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environment with additionally [`keras`](https://pypi.org/project/Keras/) and [`scikit-learn`](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/) installed.
